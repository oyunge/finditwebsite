                                    Lostings Inc. provides users with a unique online resource for the purpose of
                                    reuniting lost properties with their respective owners (the "Service"). Using
                                    algorithms to connect those who lost an item to those who have found a similar item,
                                    Lostings, Inc. provides a unique approach in which individuals can search or input
                                    lost or found property to facilitate contact with other individuals in possession or
                                    with information regarding a lost or found object.

                                <p>Since user verification on the Internet is difficult, Lostings, Inc. cannot and does

                                <p>The matching service is used for matching a corresponding found object with the lost object listed. Because of the limitations of a particular description, it is possible for the automated service to omit a possible match. For example, errors in a found listing's zip code, breed of animal, or other description of property will interfere with the matching process. The matching service will also not work if the found ad is incorrectly placed, or put in the wrong category. In addition, the matching service only provides matching for the period designated, and not for prior periods. If you wish to match a lost object with a found object from the found area in a prior period (before your lost listing commenced), you will need to search the found listings manually. You will make the final determination whether an object is a valid match. The matching service will send the user information about near "matches" by email.</p>
                                <p>In addition, any item that is listed on the site will be sent to all perspective establishments where available and where accepted by such entities.</p>
