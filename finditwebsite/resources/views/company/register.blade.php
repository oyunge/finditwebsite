		<div class="info-text">
			<p>Our business lost and found software is a two-part system, which combines a lost & found matching system & inventory management software. The system works by businesses submitting a lost or misplaced items into our inventory management system for businesses. Once the submission is processed, the misplaced item will automatically be placed in our intelligent lost and found matching system. The system cross-references items that were lost to found items, based on a number of different criteria for precise matching.  Once the system finds a possible match, we notify you and connect you with the individual that lost their items.</p>
